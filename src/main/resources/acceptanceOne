As far as Kepler was concerned, elliptical orbits were merely an ad hoc hypothesis, and a rather repugnant one
at that, because ellipses were clearly less perfect than circles. Having discovered almost by accident that
elliptical orbits fit the observations well, he could not reconcile them with his idea that the planets were made to
orbit the sun by magnetic forces. An explanation was provided only much later, in 1687, when Sir Isaac Newton
published his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, probably the most important single work ever
published in the physical sciences. In it Newton not only put forward a theory of how bodies move in space and
time, but he also developed the complicated mathematics needed to analyze those motions. In addition,
Newton postulated a law of universal gravitation according to which each body in the universe was attracted
toward every other body by a force that was stronger the more massive the bodies and the closer they were to
each other. It was this same force that caused objects to fall to the ground. (The story that Newton was inspired
by an apple hitting his head is almost certainly apocryphal. All Newton himself ever said was that the idea of
gravity came to him as he sat “in a contemplative mood” and “was occasioned by the fall of an apple.”) Newton
went on to show that, according to his law, gravity causes the moon to move in an elliptical orbit around the
earth and causes the earth and the planets to follow elliptical paths around the sun. It was this same force that caused objects to fall to the ground
The Copernican model got rid of Ptolemy’s celestial spheres, and with them, the idea that the universe had a
natural boundary. Since “fixed stars” did not appear to change their positions apart from a rotation across the
sky caused by the earth spinning on its axis, it became natural to suppose that the fixed stars were objects like
our sun but very much farther away
